# Academic Literature Repository Abstract

`Academic Literature` is a repository developed to hold and present literature on topics I found interesting and did a bit of research on. 

### Content
Here I discuss topics dealing with `electromobility`, `Offshore Wind Power`, `Sustainabilty` in industries, `Environmental Reporting` of Companies and more.
Also featured are works I co-authored or assisted in. 

The layout is very simple; lists of presentations and reports are collected. Have a look!
